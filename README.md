TDA Drugs script remake.


This script was created by 4Slang. The script may be used by anyone but it may not be sold. 

For modifications of coords: 

Coke and Meth locations can be adjusted in server/main.lua line 22 value 1,2,3 are the locations chosen randomly. If you add a location to this the number should of course be 4. For weed you can adjust the coords on line 664.

If you make changes to the script yourself, I cannot offer further help to the script.
